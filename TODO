- Move socket from items level to base level (on all tiled level)
  NOTE: this is likely a blocking issue. I don't think files will parse without it.

- Add velocity property to all monster tiles

- Add "help" string property for all levels

- Add support for binding help string to help tile.

- Fix GCC bug regarding implicit conversion of lambda to function pointer
   I think the bug only affects entity::set_method but I won't change it until
   its reproduced. 

- Remove texture_index.

- Add support for blue-button -> tank binding and green-button -> toggle-wall binding
  (all blue-buttons bind to all tanks and green buttons to all toggle walls,
   so bind actions don't need to be specified for these)

- Create game-handler. It should have a draw and an update methods. It should
  Take a level and run it until the level is finished or the window is closed.

- Flesh out init methods for all types (adding update & collide functions for all)

- Add find_entity methods to level. these methods should search all parts of a level
  for matching entities.
