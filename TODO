- Move socket from items level to base level (on all tiled level)

- Add velocity property to all monster tiles

- Add "help" string property for all levels

- Fix GCC bug regarding implicit conversion to function pointer
   I think the bug only affects entity::set_method but I won't change it until
   its reproduced. 

- Add support for blue-button -> tank binding and green-button -> toggle-wall binding
  (all blue-buttons bind to all tanks and green buttons to all toggle walls,
   so bind actions don't need to be specified for these)

- Create game-handler.

- Flesh out init methods for all types (adding update & collide functions for all)

- Add find_entity methods to level. these methods should search all parts of a level
  for matching entities.
