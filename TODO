- Move socket from items level to base level (on all tiled level)
- Add "help" string property for all levels
- Fix GCC bug regarding implicit conversion to function pointer
- Add support for blue-button -> tank binding and green-button -> toggle-wall binding
  (all blue-buttons bind to all tanks and green buttons to all toggle walls,
   so bind actions don't need to be specified for these)
- Create game-handler.
- Flesh out init methods for all types (adding update & collide functions for all)
